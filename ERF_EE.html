									<h3>A New Employee That Was Already Participating</h3>
										<p>
											Why is this important? If the members is a 
											<span class="tooltip">high hourly rate contributor
												<span class="tooltiptext">Deduction Rate X 2,000 hours > Age Appropriate Limit</span>
											</span>
											they could go over their IRS mandated limit. You would need to know how much the member has already contributed with
											a previous employer to set any alerts or hard stop in your payroll system. Or maybe you are the Alert/Hard Stop. See
											the next section for the deduction rates and ages that make a member "plausible" to over contribute.
										</p>
									<h3>Members That Could Overcontribute (Plausibles)</h3>
										<p>
											We use a rough guideline of [Hourly Deduction Rate] do our best to divert any money that would be considered an overcontribution and return it to the employer, but it takes everyone working together to
											actually prevent this from happening. There are many different payroll systems with many different accumens for setting
											alerts, hard stops and modified contributions to take the member right up to their age appropriate limit.
										</p>
										<p>
											<h3>Contribution Limits</h3>
											<p>
												Voluntary contributions may not exceed the following amounts based on age in year 2022.
												<br>
												Members up to 49 year old:<br>
												$20,500.00
												<br>
												Members 50 years or older:<br>
												$26,500.00
