											To Trustees", which is quite a mouthful so we refer to it as the Monthly Report or the ER report. The

											as a courtesy to simplify the fringe benefits payment process.</p>

									<p>
										The step-up notification for an apprentice always comes after they have moved up in classification, 
										which means retroactive fringe benefits are due to them. The spreadsheet forms we provide can handily calculate
										these adjustment amounts due by fund. document the payment as well. Instructions are in the table below.

													Adjustments (the red arrow in the picture).

							<h2>Spreadsheet Form Layouts</h2>
									<p>
										Each spreadsheet form layout was created to accomodate employers based on their roster size and payroll system functions.
										The table below will help determine which layout should suite you best. The spreadsheet forms overhaul in 2021
										was also done to improve the accuracy of the totals on the summary worksheet.
